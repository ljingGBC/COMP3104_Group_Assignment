SDLC

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), also known as Software Development Process is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process. It is important for a DevOps engineer to learn SDLC because it makes it easier to evaluate each part of software development and to work on each phase simultaneously.
